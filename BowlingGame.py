        __init__ method:
        Parameter: self
        This initializes an instance of the BowlingGame class and creates an empty list called rolls to store the pins knocked down in each roll.

        roll method:
        Parameters: self, pins
        Argument (example): pins (e.g., when calling game.roll(5))
        This method records the result of a roll by appending the number of pins knocked down (passed as the argument pins) to the rolls list.

        score method:
        Parameter: self
        The score method is intended to calculate the total score of the game. The variables total_score and roll_index are initialized to keep track of the total score and the current roll being processed, respectively. The for loop is likely intended to loop through the 10 frames of a bowling game, though the loop itself is incomplete in the provided code.
